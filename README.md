# Fuel_Efficiency
Built a machine learning model to predict vehicle fuel efficiency based on engine size, horsepower, weight, and other vehicle metrics. Used Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib) for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, model training, and performance evaluation using metrics like RMSE and R².
