## 📘 Overview

This project focuses on predicting **fuel efficiency (MPG)** using **machine learning regression models**.  
It analyzes various automotive parameters like engine size, horsepower, cylinders, and weight to estimate how efficiently a vehicle consumes fuel.

The project is deployed as an **interactive Streamlit web app**, allowing users to input vehicle details and instantly receive MPG predictions.
